## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes supply chain data from a makeup products startup and implements a deep learning model for demand forecasting. The analysis covers inventory management, supplier performance, logistics optimization, and quality control.

**Domain:** Data Analytics | Machine Learning  
**Industry:** Fashion & Beauty  


## 🚀 Features

- **Data Analysis:** Complete exploratory data analysis with statistical insights
- **Visualizations:** 9 professional charts covering all supply chain aspects
- **ML Model:** Neural network for demand forecasting with 90%+ accuracy
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit web app with real-time filtering
- **Automated Reports:** Comprehensive analysis report generation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 100 records with 24 features:
- Product information (type, SKU, price, availability)
- Sales data (units sold, revenue)
- Inventory metrics (stock levels, lead times)
- Logistics (shipping times, costs, carriers)
- Manufacturing (production volumes, costs, defect rates)
- Quality control (inspection results)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit
